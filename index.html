      I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand <br/>
I wake in pain<br/>
I dream of love as time runs through my hand<br/>
I dream of fire<br/>
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire<br/>
And in the flames<br/>
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire<br/>
This desert rose<br/>
Each of her veils, a secret promise<br/>
This desert flower<br/>
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this<br/>
And as she turns<br/>
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams<br/>
This fire burns<br/>
I realise that nothing's as it seems<br/>
I dream of rain<br/>
I dream of gardens in the desert sand<br/>
I wake in pain<br/>
I dream of love as time runs through my hand<br/>
I dream of rain<br/>
I lift my gaze to empty skies above<br/>
I close my eyes, this rare perfume<br/>
Is the sweet intoxication of her love<br/>
I dream of rain<br/>
I dream of gardens in the desert sand<br/>
I wake in pain<br/>
I dream of love as time runs through my hand<br/>
Sweet desert rose<br/>
Each of her veils, a secret promise<br/>
This desert flower<br/>
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this<br/>
Sweet desert rose<br/>
This memory of Eden haunts us all<br/>
This desert flower, this rare perfume<br/>
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall
